- **Password Recovery:** User-friendly ‚ÄúForgot Password‚Äù flow (partially implemented).

### üñ•Ô∏è Console UI & Visuals
- **Fullscreen Console UI:** Optimized for exclusive fullscreen; makes use of cursor movement and color macros for rich, clear display.
- **Colorized Menus:** Extensive use of macros for colors and Unicode symbols for a modern look.
- **Animated Welcome:** Custom animated welcome screen using Unicode hospital icons and color sequences.

### üìã Menu-Driven Navigation
